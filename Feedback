In addition to the experimental outcomes, the feedback received from users and students in the field was overwhelmingly positive and validated the system’s practical effectiveness. Language learners, in particular, praised the model’s real-time feedback mechanism for its precision and utility in improving pronunciation. The system’s ability to identify subtle phoneme-level discrepancies and provide actionable correction suggestions was noted as a standout feature, making it a valuable tool for both self-paced and instructor-guided learning.

Educators in the field of linguistics emphasized how the system bridges a significant gap in pronunciation training tools, particularly for non-native speakers. By leveraging deep learning and Edit Distance algorithms, the system not only addresses the detection of mispronunciations but also facilitates meaningful corrections both in visual and speech form, a feature that is often missing in conventional tools. The seamless integration of IPA-based phoneme sequences into the model was lauded for its adaptability across various learning contexts.

The system was also recognized for its potential applications in specialized fields such as speech therapy and accent reduction. Therapists noted that the ability to pinpoint specific mispronunciations could aid in tailoring personalized interventions for individuals with speech impairments. Additionally, the system’s focus on the American English accent was appreciated for its relevance in global communication, though users suggested that expanding its capability to support other accents and dialects could make it even more impactful.

Feedback from students highlighted the motivational aspect of the system, as the instant, accurate feedback boosted their confidence in mastering difficult phonemes. They felt encouraged by the system's user-friendly interface and appreciated its ability to make the learning process interactive and engaging.

 Suggestions for Future Enhancements:
1. While the system performs exceptionally well with an American English accent, extending its capabilities to recognize and correct phonemes in other accents (e.g., British English, Australian English, or Indian English) could significantly broaden its applicability.
   
2. Incorporating an accent-adaptive module that adjusts the detection and correction mechanisms based on the user’s native accent could improve the model's versatility and inclusivity.


3.Integration with Speech Therapy Tools:Partnering with speech therapy platforms or language learning applications to embed this framework could increase its reach and usability.

4. The system’s effectiveness could be further enhanced by incorporating a broader range of mispronunciation types for a given word. Expanding the model to detect and correct additional variations of mispronunciations would make it even more comprehensive and versatile. This enhancement could improve its ability to handle diverse pronunciation challenges, particularly for non-native speakers who might struggle with multiple aspects of phoneme production. Such a feature would also make the system more robust and adaptive to different learning contexts, increasing its utility across various language learning and speech therapy applications.

In conclusion, the mispronunciation detection and correction system stands out as a cutting-edge solution with immense potential to revolutionize pronunciation training. With a few enhancements, it could cater to a wider audience and further establish itself as an indispensable tool for language learners, educators, and therapists alike.
